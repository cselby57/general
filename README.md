You can find some basic samples of my things I've done in /samples. Right now this just includes a psuedo random march madness bracket generator from when I was playing around with windows forms, and some ML assignments from class (Matlab). /Robogoalie will eventually be used to control code for an autonomous hockey robot, but is in very early (basically nothing) developement. Otheriwse most of what I do is for work and located elsewhere, such as behaviors written c++ for the ghost robotics minitaur used by the Robomechanics Lab at CMU.
