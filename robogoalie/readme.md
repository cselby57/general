# Robogoalie Readme

Robogoalie is a project to build a robotic ice hockey goaltender. The system will use an IR steroecamera to track the puck,
and a system of limbs will move to block it from entering the net. Not much to see now, but more to come.

Current status: very,very,early
  * goalie.py is the very beginning of a framework for the code that will eventually run the robot, very rough
  * ir_vision.py was just some experimenting with opencv from a tutorial
