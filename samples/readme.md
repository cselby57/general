# Samples

Some examples of basic codes I've written

  * bracket maker is a simple windows app for filling out pseudo random march madness brackets made when I was playing around with forms after my c++ course
  * Ankle_brace_collect is some simple arduino I used for data collection for a soft robotics clss project that involved measuring the angular state of an athletes ankle during basic activites such as running, cutting, jumping. The goal was to create an inflatable brace that could help prevent injuries due to hyperextension. The brace was minimally successful but the sensors worked fine.
